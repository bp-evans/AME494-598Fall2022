                <p>
                    As a research aide at Meteor Studios I worked in Unity Game engine to build simulated laboratory enviornments.<br>I worked on both software and hardware at the lab including AR in Unity using Vuforia.</p>

                College Technical Intern Northrop Grumman
                <p>
                    I was a intern at Northrop Grumman for two years. In the first year of the internship I worked on creating a neural network<br>to estimate the sub-pixel center of a simulated point spread function. I also created the simulated function.<br>In the second year of my internship I translated tcsh scripts to bash to make our build process more up to date. I also created a gui in python<br>for a tool for users to autogenerate certain repeated pieces of code.
